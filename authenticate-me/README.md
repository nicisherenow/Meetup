# Meet, Sup?

## My projects name is Meet, Sup?
Here is the link! [Meet, Sup?](https://meetup-clone-project.onrender.com)

My site is a clone of the [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) site. Meet, Sup? can be used create a user, create groups and events, as well as view all groups and events created by all other users!
If you're displeased with the group you make, you can always delete it! Same with events as well of course. The logo was made by me, in paint. The 404 page is an instant classic!
Thanks for taking the time to check this all out.
